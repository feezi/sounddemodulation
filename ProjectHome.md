The aim of this project is to develop modules on low level audio.Inspiration of this project is from TalkingTomCat App.After seeing that app i decided to make some cool sound modules like

->auto detection

->voice seperation

->changing playback rates etc.

The download section includes a demo talking tom cat app.
